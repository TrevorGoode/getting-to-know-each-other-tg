<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>My name is Trevor; I am a freshman this year. I am taking computer science because I love science and technology, and I have always been intruiged by the development of tech over the years. I am not particularly knowledgeable with coding or anything, so this is all pretty challenging for me. I come from a family of five kids; my older brother is 22, one of my sisters is 15, another is 9, and my youngest brother is 6. My mom has done a great job at raising all of us, and I respect her a lot. I love music and theater, and I have been into video games for as long as I can remember.</p>

<h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
<p>I love singing, but it came about unexpectedly. I was always to scared to perform in front of people, but I had some friends who pushed me to join choir. They knew I liked singing, and they persisted until I joined. My Junior year in high school I joined my school choir, show choir, and performed in the school musical. Senior year I got into varsity choir through an audition, and my only regret is not trying sooner. I sing bass, but I always try to expand my range as I practice. I am hoping to join some kind of fun singing organization at Lewis like an acapella group.
